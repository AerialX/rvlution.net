<p>Riivolution supports modular filesystems in such a way that it is not necessarily limited to using SD cards and USB devices. Using a specially-formatted XML file, Riivolution will use the Wii's wifi to connect to a server and use it like any other filesystem it supports. This means that the patches are streamed over the internet, and instantly up-to-date. It can also be used on a personal level, to allow you to edit files without even restarting the game.
</p><p>Check out the <a href="../List_of_RiiFS_servers" title="List of RiiFS servers">list of RiiFS servers</a> for a plug-and-play way to play game hacks.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Network_XML_Element">The Network XML Element</span></h2>
<p>A special element in the XML format can be used to direct Riivolution to connect to a server, which means that a SD or USB drive is required to initiate the connection. The element must be contained inside the <i>wiidisc</i> element in a normal <a href="../Patch_Format" title="Patch Format">Patch XML</a>, and has the following structure:
</p>
<pre>   &lt;network protocol="riifs" address="192.168.1.1" port="1137" /&gt;
</pre>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Attributes">Attributes</span></h3>
<ul>
<li> <i>protocol</i> - <b>string</b> - <i>optional</i> - Defaults to "<a href="../RiiFS" title="RiiFS">riifs</a>", as that is the only supported network <i>protocol</i> at the time of writing.
</li>
<li> <i>address</i> - <b>string</b> - <i>required</i> - This is the IP address of the server to connect to.
</li>
<li> <i>port</i> - <b>integer</b> - <i>optional</i> - This is the network port to connect to; defaults to 1137, which is the default <a href="../RiiFS" title="RiiFS">RiiFS</a> port.
</li>
<li> <i>log</i> - <b>boolean</b> - <i>optional</i> - Defaults to <i>false</i>, will redirect stdout/fwrite over the network when set.
</li>
</ul>
